# ng-ui-pack-lib Maintainer Guide üõ†Ô∏è

This guide explains the regular tasks and commands needed to maintain and publish your Angular UI library (`ng-ui-pack-lib`).

---

## 1. Library Development
- All components should live inside:
  `projects/ng-ui-pack-lib/src/lib/`
- Exports must be listed in:
  `projects/ng-ui-pack-lib/src/public-api.ts`

Example export:
```ts
export * from './lib/Button/button/button';
```

---

## 2. Build the Library
Command:
```bash
ng build ng-ui-pack-lib
```
This compiles your library into the `dist/ng-ui-pack-lib/` folder, which is the package ready for testing or publishing.

---

## 3. Test Locally in Demo App
To make sure your changes work before publishing, install the built library into your showcase/demo app:
```bash
npm install ./dist/ng-ui-pack-lib
ng serve
```
This allows you to test your components as a real consumer.

---

## 4. Version Bump
Every release must increment the version number in `projects/ng-ui-pack-lib/package.json`.

Options:
```bash
npm version patch   # For small bug fixes (0.0.x ‚Üí 0.0.x+1)
npm version minor   # For new features (0.x.y ‚Üí 0.x+1.0)
npm version major   # For breaking changes (x.y.z ‚Üí x+1.0.0)
```

---

## 5. Publish to npm
Once tested, publish the new version:
```bash
cd dist/ng-ui-pack-lib
npm publish --access public
```
Your library will then be available on npm.

---

## 6. Update Demo App (Showcase)
To consume the newly published version in your demo app:
```bash
npm install ng-ui-pack-lib@latest
```
This ensures the demo site reflects the latest package.

---

## 7. Deploy Showcase (GitHub Pages)
Rebuild your demo app for GitHub Pages:
```bash
ng build --base-href /ng-ui-pack/
```
Deploy to `gh-pages` branch:
```bash
npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/ng-ui-pack/browser
```
Check it live at:
`https://<username>.github.io/ng-ui-pack/`

---

## 8. Keep Documentation Updated
- Update `projects/ng-ui-pack-lib/README.md` ‚Üí shows up on npm package page.
- Update the repo root `README.md` ‚Üí includes demo link, install instructions, and usage examples.

---

# ‚úÖ Most Common Workflow

When making a change:

```bash
# 1. Build library
ng build ng-ui-pack-lib

# 2. Test locally in demo app
npm install ./dist/ng-ui-pack-lib
ng serve

# 3. Publish new version
npm version patch     # or minor/major
ng build ng-ui-pack-lib
cd dist/ng-ui-pack-lib
npm publish --access public

# 4. Update demo app
npm install ng-ui-pack-lib@latest

# 5. Deploy showcase
ng build --base-href /ng-ui-pack/
npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/ng-ui-pack/browser
```

---

‚ö° Pro Tip: Always test locally in your demo app **before publishing** to npm. This prevents buggy versions from being uploaded.
